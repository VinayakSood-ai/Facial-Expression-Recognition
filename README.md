In this project, I have chosen the subset of dataset: FER-2013 (2 classes: happy and sad) 
posted on Kaggle. We are performing the task of Facial Expression Recognition. In this task we first 
extract feature vectors using various feature extraction algorithms such as: histogram of oriented 
gradients (HOG); scale invariant feature transform (SIFT); combination of histogram of oriented 
gradients (HOG) and local binary patterns (LBP); combination of histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) 
and gabor filters; combination of histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) and scale invariant feature 
transform (SIFT); combination of histogram of oriented gradients (HOG), local binary patterns (LBP) and 
gabor filters.   After feature extraction we are performing classification task using various classification 
algorithms such as:  Random Forest classifier, Support Vector Machines (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbors 
Classifier (KNN). We will compare the approaches and conclude which is the best feature extraction and 
classifier combination by measuring the accuracy.
